There are NUMOROUS blog posts stating people can't boot from USB on their Surface Pros - most of them ended up having Surface Support exchanging their devices because even Surface support thinks this is a hardware problem. I even went through this and they opened a return ticket for me. It was just as I was getting ready to do this, I discovered UEFI devices can't boot from NTFS.",
