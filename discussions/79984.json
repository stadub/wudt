I really think this would be an important change in the method of booting setup from USB, if an end user was able to optionally boot from USB then I'd leave the BIOS set to boot from USB first, currently this is a bad idea due to the Setup Loop problem mentioned above. If the ntldr was able to ask if booted from USB drive, or chain the boot back to the first HDD if not pressed then it would be easier to tell someone how to install it.</p>",
