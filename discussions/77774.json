    "Html": "<p>The greatest flaw with this tool is it's inability to work with USB HDD's, I have a few memory sticks that can fit the ISO on it, but then there isn't any space to put updates and runtimes/codec's etc without carrying extra media arround with me to do a base installation. Using other tools I was able to transfer the install to a USB hdd and now I have space for these extras as well as a seperate partition on the same drive to preform a backup of the PC's data before continuing to format and install the PC.</p>\r\n<p>I hope that this tool can be upgraded to support HDD's as the applying of the bootsector and setting it to active is the same process used for memory sticks, so if the checking for drive type on the destination screen were laxed or even optional with a warning, we'd have the most successful and simplified USB creation solution on the net.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for your work</p>",

The boot sector/files do not require a formatted drive to be applied so just make it not format USB HDD's and it'll keep people safe from accidents, and the smart people (like me and the nice guy above) will simply use Explorer to format our drives if we have boot problems with it while maintaining USB HDD safety for novices.</p>\r\n<p>The goal for WUDT should be and always have been, a way to make installing your great products from ANY form of USB Bootable Media, not limited to ThumbDrive only support. I attempted to fix this myself but the VS2008 C# was unable to make sense of some of the code during compiling (I since read about the Addon that was needed, but would prefer a proper in house release than starting off my own maintenance version.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Best of luck and please do your best to impress us, this is the time to be preparing for USB 3, Having Windows installed in 5 minutes from USB 3 to SSD</p>",
